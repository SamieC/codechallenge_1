1. For StudentGrade- This allows user to input marks and returns the subsequent Grade.

This allows one to input current speed of a user and will show is speed is above limit. If it is it will add points per every 5 km/h(assumed from KM/s as stated in question). if the points exceeded are above 12, it will let the user know that the lisense is suspended. 

3. For NetSalary- This allows one to input the basic salary and it will return, gross salary, deductions as well as net salary.
    There are alot of assumtions and i took liberties with them. NHIF and NSSF are fixed and not taxed- taken as a Tax relief. 
    There are no benefits exempted for this model.
    Tax rates are shown in the code.
